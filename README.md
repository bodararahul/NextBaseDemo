# Nextbase

Nextbase is a simple, fast, and secure way to build and deploy your next web application. It's built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). It is fully typed and uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which means you can build your app with confidence.
